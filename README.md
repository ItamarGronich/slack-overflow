This is an AJAX exercise. A simple forum that POSTs and GETs messages from the main server.

This exercise was made as part of an AJAX class. Using plain JavaScript and making a large AJAX function
with a callback to exectue all possible requests the particular server could handle.

Simply fill out your name and tyoe your message, press send and the message will be sent to the general
